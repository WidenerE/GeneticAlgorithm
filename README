This program simulates the births, deaths, and evolution of organism "cells" over multiple generations based on a static set of rules that can produce
a variety of successful patterns.

The user has the option of providing a file containing a 20 x 20 board of cells where an X indicates a living cell and a 0 an empty index.
If the user does not provide a file on the command line, a board is randomly generated.

The user is then propmted for how many generations they would like to simulate evolution for, and the initial board is displayed.
The program then simulates and displays the specified number of generations.

The program uses a 2 dimensional array for the board and the "cells" are structs containing information such as each cell's age, how
many neighbors it has, and if the cell is alive or not. By encapsulaing this information in structs, it is a simple matter for the 
program to keep track of information for each index on the board, and cells' attributes can be manipulated without changing the board state,
ensuring that the births and deaths of each generation occur simultaneously.
